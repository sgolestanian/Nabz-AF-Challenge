# Submission Guide
In order to submit your code for scoring, your code must follow the template code in <model.py>
During the test, `AFDetector.classify` method will be called and an ecg of any length will be passed.

If you need to load a file in your code, keep in mind that any file you give us will be placed in the same directory as <model.py> code.
